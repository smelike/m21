To handle the requirement of measuring a stable weight value of a package moving on a conveyor belt at 60 meters per minute, we need to sample the weight data over a suitable period and then process this data to determine a stable value. Here's how you can incorporate this into the `WeightSensor` class.

### Algorithm Overview:
1. **Sampling Interval**: Given the conveyor speed of 60m/min (which is 1000mm/s) and a conveyor length of 1180mm, we can calculate the time it takes for the package to pass through the weighing station.
2. **Data Collection**: Continuously read the weight at regular intervals during this time.
3. **Data Processing**: Use a method such as averaging or selecting the median weight to determine a stable value.

### Implementation in `WeightSensor` Class:
Here's the updated `WeightSensor` class with methods to handle continuous sampling and determining a stable weight:

# Usage example:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sampling Weights**:
   - The `sample_weight` method reads weight values continuously over the specified duration.
   - Weights are sampled every 0.05 seconds (adjustable as needed).

2. **Stable Weight Calculation**:
   - The `get_stable_weight` method calculates the median weight from the sampled values. You can use the mean or another method if preferred.

3. **Measurement Process**:
   - The `measure_weight` method calculates the duration based on the conveyor speed and belt length.
   - It then samples weights over this duration and determines a stable weight.

4. **Integration**:
   - The `measure_weight` method can be called after establishing the connection to the sensor to get the stable weight of a moving package.

This approach ensures that the weight measurement is stable and accurate, taking into account the movement of the package on the conveyor belt.
